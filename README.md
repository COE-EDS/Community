[IriusRisk Community Edition](https://community.iriusrisk.com) is a free version of IriusRisk that allows you to quickly model software security risks using a template based approach, and then manage those risks throughout the rest of the SDLC, including:
* Assigning a risk response: Accept, Mitigate or Expose
* Apply a security standard, such as OWASP ASVS to derive the security requirements in one step
* Automatically upload security controls as requirements to Jira
* Synchronise the current implementation state of the requirements with Jira and automatically adjust the associated risk rating
* Create templates of threat models and share them with the community
* Import and Export the threat models in an open XML format
* Import threats and controls from Microsoft Threat Modeller version 4.  (Version 2016 support coming soon).
