[IriusRisk Community Edition](https://community.iriusrisk.com) allows you to quickly model software security risks using a template based approach, and then manage those risks throughout the rest of the SDLC, including:
* Assigning a risk response: Accept, Mitigate or Transfer
* Apply a security standard, such as OWASP ASVS to derive the security requirements in one step
* Upload security requirements to Jira
* Synchronise the current implementation state of the requirements with Jira and automatically adjust the associated risk
* Import security vulnerabilities from [ThreadFix](http://www.threadfix.org)
