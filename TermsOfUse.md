## Terms of Use

Welcome to the community version of IriusRisk, we trust that it will help you build more secure software, faster!

Threat models created in the system can be imported and exported as raw XML, and this feature will always be available in this and future version of the system.

IriusRisk relies on a knowledgebase of threat, weakness and countermeasure data that is grouped into risk patterns (patterns of risk related to a specific component or use-case). By taking part in the Community edition, we hope that you'll publish your threat models as 'Templates' so that other users can benefit from them.  You'll find this option on the Product Action menu for a given product.
